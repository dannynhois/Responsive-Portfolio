			<p>
				My name is Danny and I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. I went to the University of Houston where I graduated with an Accounting Degree. I've been married for almost 3 years and I'm currently trying to figure out how to raise a 14-month-old toddler. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I used to love playing video games but now don't have as much time to play as I would like. I enjoy doing things that involve physical activity such as playing basketball, football, or lifting weights. I recently got into brazilian jiu-jitsu which has been fun and challenging at the same time.
